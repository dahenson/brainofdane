Title: restless

I've switched my blog... again.  This time it's powered by Pelican, and it doesn't have comments.  If you want to talk, find me on one of the many social networks.

I know I should be content with what I have, but it's so hard not to get restless after a while.  First it was learning to program again, then it was learning how to write a GUI, then it was back to writing a book.  November was when I stopped feeling as wrestless.  I put <a href="http://launchpad.net/agenda">Agenda</a> aside for a little down time while I participated in <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org">NaNoWriMo</a>.  It was a relief to stop thinking in source code all the time, but it was stressful trying to write up a fictional world.

At the start of the year, I funneled a ton of energy into getting a little web series off the ground, but I'm stalled out on that now too.  The desire is there, but my wife and I lack the time and energy to keep the ball rolling.

Now, I'm back at it again trying to figure out what it is I want to do with the precious little time I have.  I'm learning a little Python, I'm pretty much done with Ruby, I'm wanting to do something personally significant maybe.  That's not to say I'm unhappy.  I'm very happy.

I just feel restless.  All pent up with nowhere to go.  Maybe if I blog regularly, I can straighten out my thoughts.
