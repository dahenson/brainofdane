Title: utility apps

I (maybe even we, if you agree) have had my view of software completely redefined recently.  It started happening after I bought my first smart phone.  The shift was very subtle until it hit me in the face the other day.

I was looking for an "app"; not an application, because that's so '90's.  I wanted to try out this [Pomodoro Technique](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/) everyone talks about.  The technique is super simple and all you need is a countdown timer that will count down from 25 minutes.  You work for 25 minutes, then every 25 minutes you take a break for 5 or 10 minutes.

You don't need an "app" to do it, just a timer.  Well, in my newly twisted view of the world, there is an app for everything and gosh darn it, there are about 10 billion different Pomodoro apps.  You can't just have one.  Everyone wants their app to be just a little bit different than the rest.  Better probably... maybe...

I call these utility apps.  I remember when the iPhone first started gaining popularity and "there's an app for that" became a thing.  A new kind of app emerged with multiple utilities rolled into one: compass, level, timer, alarm, 'flashlight', etc.  It was all kind of ridiculous, but people loved it.

I don't think utility apps are a bad thing.  Even after realizing the futility of having both a timer and a Pomodoro app on my phone, I still wanted the right one for the job.  A simple timer isn't pre-set for 25 minutes.  It doesn't have a preset for short breaks, and long breaks.  Okay, those are silly reasons, but that still didn't stop me.

What I find refreshing is that these utility apps breed refinement.  The Pomodoro craze might not be the best example.  Some of the worst offenders in the software industry are e-mail clients.  I understand that some people can't live without the beast that is Outlook, but my work laptop seems to run 50% slower because of that stupid 300-pound gorilla.  Instead of building a monolithic e-mail/calendar/todo list/coffee maker, you build a [really good e-mail client](http://www.yorba.org/geary/) that does just that and refine it.

I'm sure there are plenty of fruitless endeavors out there, but making an "app" can't be all that bad.  I've [done it myself](https://launchpad.net/agenda-tasks) from time to time.
