Title: resource management

One of the biggest complaints I hear amongst the noise of the Linux community has to do with resource management.  Does anyone else see the serious flaw with that?

- Dude has an idea
- Dude designs an application (this step tends to be fairly minimal for OSS)
- Dude pounds out some code
- Dude shares to his favorite code repository
- The occasional interested party hacks on it at will

Is there a manager? No, unless you mean a dude who had an idea, but there is no incentive to make anyone do anything other than test for bugs and complain about bugs.

Sure, in the case of Ubuntu, there are resources to be managed by a legitimate manager.  However, most of the smoke being blown is centered around forking and startup projects.  When the e-mail client of the month comes along to trump all clients (or in Geary's case, just be really good at a few things), what good does it do to yell at the devs to go help 'X' client instead?

Does yelling at a melon make it any less of a melon?

Whether you think all resources should be pooled, or you believe in the "competition is good" mantra, your hot air is most likely in vain.  The dude has already fired off some code, which means he's probably totally invested in doing his own thing anyway.
