Baby, I miss you and I haven't even met you yet.

Yesterday was the due date, but nothing happened.  I know birth is completely unpredictable, but it's hard not to set *some* expectations.  Two weeks ago, we were totally ready to go.  We had no doubt that Eli would be born any minute.  Now, I'm not so sure.

It seems like every day, Shari tells me she feels different.  Today could be the day, tomorrow could be the day, right this second she's probably having a contraction.  I don't know what to believe any more, and neither does she.

I just can't wait to meet my son and it's really hard to live life normally when you know a big event could happen at any given second.  This is exhausting.
