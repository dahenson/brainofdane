+++

My [wife](http://amombrain.wordpress.com/) and I have officially reached the point in our pregnancy that people like to call "Full Term".  Yes, the bun in the oven has baked long enough that he could come at any time.

I'm not freaking out.

*I'm freaking out.*

I'm not really freaking out.

*I'm really freaking out.*

I mean, we've done this before.  We have a 3 year old that came out of my wife.  We can do this again.  At this point, we have to do it again.  As soon as that little stick showed that little plus sign, there was no turning back.

This is fresh on my mind as we go through birthing classes and meet with our midwife.  I'm so proud of my wife for knowing what's about to come and still going through with it.

I know that both of us can't wait to meet our little boy.
