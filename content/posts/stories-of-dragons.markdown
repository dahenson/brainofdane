I could spend hours telling you stories about my kids. They are lovable, funny, smart, and downright amazing. I don't broadcast those stories here or on social media because some people love to listen, while others just glaze over when I talk about kids. Know your audience, right?

We have a "third" son who is no longer living with us. He went back to his biological father. Last we heard, he is doing very well. We miss him. I miss him, but I know he's with people who love him. I could talk your ear off about him if you let me. As a matter of fact, I would love to talk your ear off about him because I think I'm starting to forget.

As time passes, my memories fade, and I wish I had written a lot of it down. That particular son had quite a few medical conditions that required a lot of loving care to give him a long life. There were nights that I remember praying myself to sleep over him. I didn't care how long we had him, I just wanted him to be healthy. I prayed that he wouldn't suffer, and that he would live a long, joyful life. I still pray for him.

Yesterday, I stumbled across a new game in the works called *[That Dragon, Cancer](http://thatdragoncancer.com/)*. It is an immersive adventure about raising a son in the face of that terrible beast we call cancer.

Grab the kleenex, go to their site, scroll down a little ways, and watch the video. I'll wait.

...

My first reactions: Why would you do that??? Why would you make such a depressing, horrible video game about cancer? What is the point? My eyes are totally not dry any more.

I'll tell you the point.

These parents want to tell their story just as badly as I want to tell mine. I can guarantee that amidst the crushing weight of a losing battle with cancer, there is an immeasurable amount of hope and grace. They want to share that with the world.

I know these things because I have had a similar experience on a much smaller scale. We have spent sleepless nights in a hospital next to our sweet baby. We have been worried sick when the doctors tell us they don't know exactly what's wrong. Every parent has been through at least one thing that made them question the meaning of life and parenting.

To be honest, I don't think I could bring myself to play that particular video game. I wouldn't be able to see anything through my tears. It just hits way too close to home. However, I am glad these parents were able to not only tell their story, but let people experience it. And now, they won't forget. They won't forget, and neither will anyone else brave enough to play their game.

Last night, I spent a long time playing with my two healthy boys. I just soaked it all in, and if you're a parent I recommend you do the same. If nothing else, *That Dragon, Cancer* reminded me that I am extremely lucky to have what I have.
