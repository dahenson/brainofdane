*The greatest minds are forged in the fires of a bowling ball factory.*

That was what Barry said to us the day we started the Rube Goldberg machine in our front yard. I hate to say it, but I followed that man wherever he went. He was my savior.

It was my freshman year in college and after 18 years in my hometown, I had been craving something new--someone new--to experience. This man was it. The guy was a veritable one-man show. He was charismatic, dramatic, enigmatic, and extremely bright. Some nights we would be up until 6am galavanting about town, only to find that he had a senior-level physics test at 8am. Of course, he would pass it without breaking a sweat. We would then spend the next night celebrating until the crack of dawn. Looking back, most of my freshman and sophomore memories have merged into one long exciting night, broken up by the occasional lab project or test.

The grass was only just peeking through the thin layer of snow the day we saw the flier. Barry was extatic as ever, gesturing wildly with his hands.

"It'll be awesome! We can combine our brain power and come up with some crazy ideas. Remember that jet-powered RC car you built with the thrust vectoring?" He didn't wait for me to answer.

I remembered the RC car and wondered how thrust vectoring could possibly apply to cracking an egg onto a pan.  Barry spun on his heels and continued to talk while he walked. I followed close behind and watched the multi-colored toggles on his backpack waggle to his stride.

Traditionally, Rube Goldberg machines had ball bearings on tracks, and dominos, and candles burning through string. The idea was to take a simple task and make it as mechanically complicated as possible. The end result was always something wildly entertaining--for engineers anyway--and very unreliable.

"...and then we could have it wrap around the ladder in an arc and hit the... are you listening, Sam?"

I stumble-skipped to catch up to him and nodded. "Yeah, sounds great. When do we start?"

As the spring sun melted away the ice, our
